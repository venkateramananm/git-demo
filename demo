under your username/repo name you can see "Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before" here we can see quick setup by there we can setup our file directly 

if we save without giving file name it will save readme file (No problem we can change late) 
we can also see what you have commited(Means what you have made changes with each identifiers)
red is deleted and green in added in new file 


open visual studio and open terminal in that and type git clone and copy the ssh code from your remote repository and paste 
here by typing the command 

                        git clone "<-- your code"-->" 

your cloned file will get displayed in the folder you choosed 

TO ENTER INTO THE CLONED FILE 

                        <cd file name >


if we want to list the things in your folder then type 

                   <ls>
